# puppet-zookeeper

Wirbelsturm-compatible [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) module to deploy [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)
servers.

You can use this Puppet module to deploy ZooKeeper to physical and virtual machines, for instance via your existing
internal or cloud-based Puppet infrastructure and via a tool such as [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) for local
and remote deployments.

# Quick start

See section [Usage examples](#usage) below.


<a name="features"></a>

# Features

* Decouples code (Puppet manifests) from configuration data (Hiera) through the use of Puppet parameterized classes,
  i.e. class parameters.  Hence you should use Hiera to control how ZooKeeper is deployed and to which machines.
* Supports RHEL OS family (e.g. RHEL 6, CentOS 6, Amazon Linux).
    * Code contributions to support additional OS families are welcome!
* ZooKeeper is run under process supervision via [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org/) version 3.0+.


<a name="requirements"></a>

# Requirements and assumptions

* This module requires that the target machines to which you are deploying ZooKeeper have **yum repositories**
  **configured** for pulling the ZooKeeper package (i.e. RPM).
    * One option is to use the ZooKeeper RPM provided by Cloudera.  See
      [cloudera-cdh4.repo](http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh4/redhat/6/x86_64/cdh/cloudera-cdh4.repo).
* This module requires that the target machines have a **Java JRE/JDK installed** (e.g. via a separate Puppet module
  such as [puppetlabs-java](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-java)).  You may also want to make sure that the
  Java package is installed _before_ ZooKeeper to prevent startup problems.
    * Because different teams may have different approaches to install "base" packages such as Java, this module does
      intentionally not puppet-require Java directly.
* This module requires the [puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor) module.  It is recommended
  that you add this modules to your Puppet setup via [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet).
  See the `Puppetfile` snippet in section _Installation_ below for a starting example.
* This module has primarily been tested with ZooKeeper 3.4.5.


<a name="installation"></a>

# Installation

It is recommended to use [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) to add this module to your
Puppet setup.

Add the following lines to your `Puppetfile`:

```
mod 'zookeeper',
  :git => 'https://github.com/miguno/puppet-zookeeper.git'
```

Then use librarian-puppet to install (or update) the Puppet module.


<a name="configuration"></a>

# Configuration

* See [init.pp](manifests/init.pp) for the list of currently supported configuration parameters.  These should be self-explanatory.
* See [params.pp](manifests/params.pp) for the default values of those configuration parameters.


<a name="usage"></a>

# Usage


<a name="configuration-examples"></a>

## Configuration examples


<a name="hiera"></a>

### Using Hiera

Simple example, using default settings.  This will start a ZooKeeper server that listens on port `2181/tcp`.

```yaml
---
classes:
  - zookeeper::service
```

More sophisticated example that overrides some of the default settings:

```yaml
---
classes:
  - zookeeper::service

zookeeper::autopurge_snap_retain_count: 3
zookeeper::max_client_connections: 500
zookeeper::myid: 1

## If you want to use a quorum (of usually 3 or 5 ZooKeeper servers), use a configuration similar
## to the following.  Make sure to set 'zookeeper::myid' appropriately for the machines in the
## quorum (myid must match 'server.X').
##
#zookeeper::quorum:
#  - 'server.1=zookeeper1:2888:3888'
#  - 'server.2=zookeeper2:2888:3888'
#  - 'server.3=zookeeper3:2888:3888'
```

A "full" example that includes the deployment of [supervisord](http://www.supervisord.org/) via
[puppet-supervisor](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-supervisor).

```yaml
---
classes:
  - supervisor
  - zookeeper::service

supervisor::logfile_maxbytes: '20MB'
supervisor::logfile_backups: 5
```


<a name="manifests"></a>

### Using Puppet manifests

_Note: It is recommended to use Hiera to control deployments instead of using this module in your Puppet manifests_
_directly._

TBD


<a name="service-management"></a>

## Service management

To manually start, stop, restart, or check the status of the ZooKeeper service, respectively:

    $ sudo supervisorctl [start|stop|restart|status] zookeeper

Example:

    $ sudo supervisorctl status zookeeper
    zookeeper                        RUNNING    pid 16461, uptime 2 days, 22:41:21

You can also use ZooKeeper's [Four Letter Words](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands)
to interact with ZooKeeper.

    # Example: Ask ZooKeeper "Are you ok?"
    $ echo ruok | nc <zookeeper-ip> 2181
    imok


<a name="log-files"></a>

## Log files

_Note: The locations below may be different depending on the ZooKeeper RPM you are actually using._

* ZooKeeper log file: `/var/log/zookeeper/zookeeper.log`
* Supervisord log files related to ZooKeeper processes:
    * `/var/log/supervisor/zookeeper/zookeeper.out`
    * `/var/log/supervisor/zookeeper/zookeeper.err`
* Supervisord main log file: `/var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log`


<a name="todo"></a>

# TODO

* Enhance in-line documentation of Puppet manifests.
* Use a hash data structure to allow the user to configure non-critical ZooKeeper configuration parameters
  (which means we don't have to manually add a class parameter to support each possible ZooKeeper config
  setting).
* Add unit tests and specs.
